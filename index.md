# Haftu Hiluf Kahsay
**RF/MMIC Design Engineer**  
_PhD Researcher in High-Frequency Electronics_

---

I specialize in Ka-band power amplifier design using GaN-on-SiC technologies. My work spans transistor-level design, harmonic balance simulation, waveform engineering, and stability analysis of MMICs, with a focus on advanced architectures like Doherty and Outphasing.

Currently conducting research at **XLIM Research Institute** and working as a visiting designer at **UMS**, I use industry-standard tools including **Keysight ADS**, **Momentum**, **Ansys HFSS**, and **CST Studio Suite**.
